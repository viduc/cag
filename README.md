CLEAN ARCHITECTURE GENERATOR - CAG
-------

The cag library allows you to create a development structure using a 
hexagonal type architecture. This structure will be created within your 
project or framework in an isolated folder. Once your structure is created, 
it is advisable to uninstall cag from your project.
